1. You must have PowerShell installed

2. PowerShell must be run in administrator mode

3. When you open PowerShell you must enter the following command : "cd [path to build folder]"

4. Open the following PowerShell script "build_Image-host.ps1"

5. After you open the "build_Image-host.ps1" and when you are in the "build folder" 
   click the run button which is the green right arrow at the top of the page.

6. The PowerShell scrip will automatically handle tagging and untagging any exisitng images for MicrobeTraceNext.

7. When the docker container is successfully built you re-tag with the correct version number.
   An example re-tagging the Docker container image is as follows:
   docker tag 50e030d7cb74 firstgensisbpaas/microbetracenext-webforms:1.2.4  
   -The 04843a2d4869 represents the image ID for the newly created Docker images built with this PowerShell script.
   -firstgensisbpaas/microbetracenext-webforms represents the actual repository and name of the container image.
   -:1.2.0 represents the desired version number of the newly created Docker Container image.

8. After tagging with the desired tag version number, you can push to Docker Hub.
   An exmaple of the Docker push command is as follows:
   docker push firstgensisbpaas/microbetracenext-webforms:1.2.0
   - firstgensisbpaas/microbetracenext-webforms represents the actual repository and name of the container image.

9. After pushing to Docker Hug goto the Google Cloud Console and edit the YAML for the MicrobeTraceNext workload to reflect the new version.
